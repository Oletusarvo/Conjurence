## Overview

We are working on a web-app which let's people create unofficial, small, local social events, that other users
can discover and join.

## Vibe Of The App

The brand-image of the app is paranormal- or ghost-inspired: people create events and conjure other people to show up. All copy on the page should have a relaxed tone with very subtle nods to the paranormal, but not making it the center. Currently it has a black-and-gray theme with orange highlights, but could possibly move towards a purpley-blue theme.

## Features

Users can create events with a title, description, spots available and category. Each event has a location set based on where the host is when they create it. This is used to show other users how far away from them the event is, and to filter events by distance. If a user clicks the I am
interested-button for an event, they will be automatically joined as an attendant to that event once they arrive within a set distance from where
it takes place. All users can show interest and observe the participants on any event.
