## Overview

We are working on a web-app which let's people create unofficial, small, local social events, that other users
can discover and join. We got the idea from our own experience of being outside playing board-games and such, being open
to other people joining us. The problem is that strangers are likely not confident enough to walk up and join, therefore
an app where such events are listed, was born.

## Features

### Events

Users can create events with a title, description, spots available and category. Each event has a location set based on where the host is when they create it. Other users can show interest on any event by clicking a button. Once they have, they will be automatically joined to the event
when they are physically close to it. Conversely, when they move far enough, they will automatically leave. If the host moves too far from the event they created, it will be automatically ended.
