# Conjurence

**Conjurence** is an app where users create custom events that other users can discover and join, by first showing interest on them through the click of a button, and then physically moving to the event's proximity.
The app is meant to be an organic low-friction hub for finding things happening in a user's local area.

Currently the geolocation functionality of the app only works when the app is open; background geolocation is planned, if
we can get it to work. Thus the code related to it should be regarded as work-in-progress.
